## questions

### unresolved

- check if aws internet gateway is necessary for architecture

### solved

- how do i block a page from unauthorized users in next.js?
  - if you're using auth.js for authentication:
    - front-end: `useSession()`, `if (!session) { redirect("/api/auth/signin?callbackUrl=/exercises"); }`
    - back-end: wrap api function for a specific http verb (e.g. `PUT`, `GET`, etc) with `auth()`
      - e.g. `export const POST = auth(async function POST(req: Request)`
- what is the directory structure for components?
  - everything is explained in [next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- how do i setup terraform for aws?
  - how do i add my credentials?
    - generate aws access keys, source them in `.env` or store them in aws secrets manager
  - run `terraform init` in project's root directory
- how do i give access between rds and ec2?
  - security groups define which traffic is allowed between aws resources
  - ec2 will also need credentials (connection string) to make requests to rds
- how much should i know about policies?
  - basic structure of the configuration file
  - ID
  - statements
  - effect
  - actions
  - conditions
- how do i configure nginx?
  - implement basic nginx.conf and a Dockerfile that will run nginx
  - do i change my current image (node.js official)?
    - yes, use one image to run next.js and another to run nginx
- how do i start nginx inside ec2's docker container? docker compose
- how do i run migrations in rds?
  - add your computer to the ingress rules
  - connect to postgresql database using `psql` with credentials
  - migrate with goose
- where do i store each credential? (e.g. aws secrets manager, github secrets, my own computer)
  - aws credentials
  - database credentials
  - google auth credentials
- ec2 setup
  - don't forget to configure security groups in terraform file
  - install aws cli, docker, docker compose
- how do i get ssl certificate? use certbot
- should i scp to copy my .env vars to ec2 instance or use aws secrets manager?
  - aws secrets manager is safer
- should i use nginx or other aws service to serve as reverse-proxy with my deployment? nginx container
- what is the purpuse of `certbot/www` and `certbot/conf` directory?
  - `certbot/www`: temporary challenge files for domain verification
    - what are challenge files?
      - temporary verification files that certbot creates to prove that you own a domain before issuing an SSL certificate
    - when certbot needs to prove domain ownership, it places challenge files inside this directory
  - `certbot/conf`: stores certbotâ€™s configuration
    - stores SSL certificates and renewal settings
    - after a certificate is issued, the private key, full chain and other related files are stored here
    - when the certificate needs renewal, certbot updates this directory
- how frequently should i renew certificate?
  - Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days
  - it's recommended to renew them each 60 days
- which ec2 base image should i use? (maybe create container image for it and store in IAM)
  - OS: Ubuntu
- how do i obtain ssl certificate for nginx? `certbot`
- how do i register a domain (pesodevops.com)?
  - route 53
  - register domain
  - set hosted zones to point to registered domain
  - can i do it with only terraform?
    - it's better to register the domain with aws console
    - define records within terraform
- after pushing docker image to ecr, how does ec2 pull it?
  - `aws ecr get-login-password --region sa-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin [AWS_ACCOUNT_ID].dkr.ecr.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com`
    - how long does this authentication last? 12 hours
    - does it work inside ec2 instance? how?
      - yes
- how should i add my .env to aws secrets manager? terraform variables in `terraform.tfvars` that are initialized in `main.tf`
- how do i create a domain for my website? register desired domain with aws route 53

## pseudocode for CI/CD pipelines

- workflow to build and push docker image
  - checkout code
  - configure aws credentials
  - login into aws ecr
  - build and push docker image to ecr
- workflow to pull from github origin and ecr to deploy application
  - ssh into ec2
    - how do i use .pem to ssh into ec2? copy file's content and paste into github's repo secrets
    - how do i pass .env vars to dockerfile securely? aws secrets manager
  - pull container images from ecr
  - delete `docker-compose.yml` in ec2 instance
  - copy `docker-compose.yml` to ec2 instance
  - get credentials
  - run `docker-compose down`
  - run `docker-compose up -d`
